- **Real-Time Processing**: Enjoy quick encoding and decoding with minimal latency.
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with Flutter, DigiPin works on both iOS and Android devices.
- **Open Source**: Contribute to the project and help improve it.

## Installation

To get started with DigiPin, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mivamoto/DigiPin.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd DigiPin
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Flutter installed. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the App**:
   You can run the app using:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Usage

Once you have the app running, you can easily encode and decode Digipins. Hereâ€™s how:

1. **Encoding**:
   - Input your data into the designated field.
   - Click on the "Encode" button.
   - The encoded Digipin will appear on the screen.

2. **Decoding**:
   - Paste the encoded Digipin into the input field.
   - Click on the "Decode" button.
   - The original data will be displayed.

## How It Works

DigiPin leverages the Digipin package to perform its encoding and decoding functions. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how the process works:

- **Encoding**: The app takes your input data and converts it into a Digipin format using a specific algorithm. This format is designed to be compact and easy to use.

- **Decoding**: The app reverses the encoding process, allowing you to retrieve the original data from the encoded Digipin.

### Technical Details

- **Framework**: Flutter
- **Language**: Dart
- **Dependencies**: The project uses the Digipin package, which handles the core encoding and decoding functionalities.
